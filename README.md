# Surfaces-Classification-Machine-Learning-Project

## Overview
This repository contains a machine learning project focused on the classification of surface types using a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier. The dataset was collected from an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) mounted to a rollator (a type of mobility aid), with data recorded across five different surface types: Asphalt, Concrete, Grass, Stone, and Tile.

The primary objective of this project is to assist individuals with mobility challenges who use a rollator by providing real-time surface detection. Since the level of difficulty in walking can vary depending on the surface, this system has the potential to enhance safety and comfort by identifying and adapting to different walking conditions.
